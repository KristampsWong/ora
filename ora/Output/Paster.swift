//
//  Paster.swift
//  ora
//
//  Inserts a string at the cursor of the frontmost application by
//  hijacking the general pasteboard, synthesizing Cmd+V, then restoring
//  the user's previous pasteboard contents. This is the same recipe
//  every mainstream macOS dictation tool uses — direct Accessibility
//  text insertion (AXUIElement + kAXValueAttribute) works in some apps
//  but fails in browsers, Electron, and games, whereas the synthetic
//  paste path reaches anywhere a human can paste manually.
//
//  ## Required permissions
//
//  Posting synthetic keyboard events through `CGEvent.post(tap:)`
//  requires the app to be granted **Accessibility** access in System
//  Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Accessibility. Without it,
//  `CGEvent.post` silently succeeds but no event is delivered, so the
//  user would see no paste and no error. We expose `isTrusted` and
//  `requestTrust(prompt:)` so the caller can surface a clear failure
//  before attempting the paste rather than appearing to paste into the
//  void.
//
//  ## Why a delay before restoring the pasteboard
//
//  Apps read the pasteboard asynchronously *after* Cmd+V is delivered.
//  If we restore the previous contents immediately the fast paths in
//  Chrome / Slack / VS Code will see the restored value and paste the
//  wrong thing. A short sleep (~150 ms) is enough on every app I've
//  measured. The cost is paid only on the dictation tail, after the
//  user already sees their text appear, so it's invisible in practice.
//
//  ## Snapshot fidelity
//
//  We snapshot every `(type, data)` pair currently on the pasteboard
//  and put them all back after the paste. That preserves rich content
//  the user had on the clipboard — RTF, file URLs, images — not just
//  the plain-text flavor. The transcript itself is set as `.string`
//  only, since that's what every paste target expects.
