# dev-reset.sh — wipe ora's local state so the next launch behaves
# exactly like a fresh install.
#
# What gets reset:
#   1. Any running ora process (SIGKILL — Debug-only, no graceful quit).
#   2. Microphone TCC entry for ora.
#   3. Accessibility TCC entry for ora.
#   4. ora's UserDefaults plist (selectedModelId, hasCompletedOnboarding,
#      showInDock, showInStatusBar, launchAtLogin, autoPaste, …).
#
# What does NOT get reset:
#   - Downloaded model files in Application Support. Wipe those manually
#     if you want to test the "no model installed" branch of onboarding.
#     Path: ~/Library/Application Support/ora/Models/<model-id>/
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/dev-reset.sh
#
# After running, launch with `./scripts/dev-run.sh` (or from Xcode) and
# you should see the floating "Get Started" window with both permission
# cards in the .notRequested state.
